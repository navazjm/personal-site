## About My Personal Site

My personal site is not only used to showcase my work experience and my favorite projects,
but also a platform for me to share my knowledge that I gain over the course of my career.

My personal site contains 3 main pages:

-   Home page:
    -   Landing page section
    -   About me section to learn about me and what tools I use
    -   Work experience section
    -   Projects section: both personal projects and open source contributions
-   Blog page
    -   Displays a list of my recent articles
    -   Search bar to filter articles based on titles or topics
    -   Featured topics section to filter articles by clicking on a hot topic
-   Post page
    -   Displays an article that the user selects from the Blog page

I used 100% custom css to have complete creative control. The color theme is heavy inspired for my love for [Nordfox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim).
