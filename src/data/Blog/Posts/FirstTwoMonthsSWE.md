## About my role as a Software Engineer

<br/>
I work as a Software Engineer at FIS, a Fortune 500 FinTech company. My role is unique as I joined under their University Program called FISU. As a FISU participant, after one year of working at FIS, they help repay the principal of any student loans I have. I also partake in biannual performance reviews, instead of an annual performance review like traditional employees. Lastly, I get to participant in seminars designed for college graduates entering the workforce. It covers topics like how to write a proper email, business etiquette, and much more. Besides all that and more, I am still a normal employee with full benefits and more.

I am on the Image Solutions ART. The product I work on allows financial institutions to have a digital archive of all their customers' documents like loan applications and more.

## Month One

<br/>
My first day as a Software Engineer began with a 9:30 am meeting. It was an orientation style meeting, where we learned more about the company and what to expect as a new employee. It was packed full of information that I honestly could not remember at the time. The meeting ended around 11:30 am. I was then required to go into the office by 1pm to get my company issued laptop. After receiving my laptop, I spent the rest of the day getting my laptop setup by doing things like: setting up VPN access, setting up Microsoft Teams and Outlook, and etc. The rest of the week was spent completing tasks in Workday and doing other onboarding modules specific for FISU employees.
<br/>
The next two-three weeks were spent setting up my development environment. The tech stack that my team uses includes C++ for a desktop GUI application and C++ backend that communicates with a SQL database. We also develope a newer modern web application which uses TypeScript and Angular on the frontend and C# and ASP.NET on the backend. Once I had majority of my environment setup I was assigned my first task, a bug fix on the C++ backend. This small bug fix allowed me to familiarize myself with the codebase and familiarize myself with our development tools. Since we are a Microsoft based company, we use Visual Studio for C++ and C# development, and Visual Studio Code for Angular and TypeScript.
<br/>
During one of the weeks setting up my development environment, I had to participant in a Virtual Learning Week. This is a required week for all FISU employees. During this week, my day was split into two parts. The first 4 hours of my day was dedicated to Learning Week and the latter part of my day was for continuing my normal work tasks, aka continue setting up my environment. During learning week, each day was composed of different meetings to learn more about the company, business ethics, and other stuff needed to be successful in our roles. In my opinion, all the meetings composed of too much information that most people are not going to retain.

## Month Two

<br/>
During Month One, I was able to setup my dev environment and complete my first user story, a small bug fix on the C++ backend. During Month Two, I got to complete two new features for our GUI application that required work on both the frontend and backend. I also improved my workflow. I want my workflow to be efficient and reduce the number of keystrokes and mouse clicks. There is still some improvement needed but I am happy with my workflow now than my workflow when I completed my first task.

## Advice for new devs

<br/>
My biggest advice is to seek help when you need it. If you get stuck on a problem, just ask for help. However, when you go to ask for help, do not just ask for help. Try your best to explain what you are having issues on, what the expected results are, and what you have tried so far. People are more willing to help when you minimize the amount of work they have to do. Also, do not be afraid to ask questions. None of my colleagues have seemed annoyed or complain when I ask a question, no matter how silly of a question it may seem. The worst thing that can happen, when you ask a question, is the person is not able to help you and they point you to someone that can.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this advice helps you. I wish you the best in your new career. As always, happy coding! ü§òüèº
